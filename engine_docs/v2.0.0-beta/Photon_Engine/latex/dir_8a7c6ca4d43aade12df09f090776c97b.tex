Defines energy emitting entities. 

Engine source files.

A standalone data container.

Without energy sources, you simply cannot take a picture of the scene. Light sources are essential for defining behaviors of radiant energy emission. Here I distinguish model and area sources by their emission profile\+: area sources have constant emission across its defined surface; whereas model sources are more general and allow texture mapped emission along with arbitrary geometry.
