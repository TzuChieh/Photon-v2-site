\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Carve out some part of an intersectable. This is a masking approach based on intersection routine. Another common approach to shape masking is BSDF-\/based, where the mask determines whether the incoming light simply passes through (a no-\/op, perfectly transmitting BSDF). There is a trade-\/off between these approaches\+: masking in intersection routine samples the mask texture (usually a slower operation) in the tight loop of acceleration structure traversal, while masking in BSDF will need to re-\/enter the acceleration structure multiple times (such as when rendering a forest) which can also be slow. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
