\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A thread pool where works are accessed concurrently by blocking other threads. A thread pool that contains fixed number of threads for work processing. It is a blocking pool, i.\+e., works are enqueued and dequeued concurrently by blocking other threads, in FIFO order. The pool can be used concurrently, namely, it is thread-\/safe. However, the user must ensure that the pool is properly initialized before subsequent usages. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
