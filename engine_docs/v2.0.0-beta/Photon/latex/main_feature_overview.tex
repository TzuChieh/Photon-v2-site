A quick overview of the features supported by Photon. Similar to \doxylink{main_project_structure_md__documentation_2project__structure}{Project Structure}, this page can also serve as a handy reference for locating the necessary documentation or source code.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Visualizer}{Visualizer}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md18}
Rendering is the process of visualizing a scene. In Photon, we utilize a \textbf{ Visualizer} to generate a \textbf{ Renderer}, which is responsible for creating a rendered image. This is where most of the core algorithms meet and work together, making it arguably the most complex part of the render engine. Photon offers a variety of renderers, each tailored to handle specific scenarios. There is no one-\/size-\/fits-\/all renderer for any types of scenes, as the effectiveness of a rendering algorithm depends heavily on the scene\textquotesingle{}s characteristics, such as geometry dimensions and material properties. At the extreme end, one can always construct a scene that will fail a certain rendering algorithm. Therefore, it is crucial to understand and experiment with different renderers when faced with rendering challenges.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_bvpt}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Unidirectional Path Tracing}{Unidirectional Path Tracing}}\label{main_feature_overview_bvpt}

This is a relatively straightforward approach to solving the {\itshape rendering equation} as proposed by Kajiya \cite{Kajiya:1986:Rendering}, and is often a good starting point before diving into more complex solvers. Backward unidirectional path tracing, however, has its limitations. It does not handle scenes with small light sources or scenes where light transport paths are difficult to trace. This renderer can be constructed by creating a \textbf{ Path\+Tracing\+Visualizer} paired with \textbf{ BVPT} energy estimator. If the rendering focuses solely on direct lighting, you may opt for the \textbf{ BVPTDL} estimator instead.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_bneept}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Unidirectional Path Tracing with NEE}{Unidirectional Path Tracing with NEE}}\label{main_feature_overview_bneept}

\doxyfigcaption{NEE can handle more complex scenes.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

With the addition of Next Event Estimation (NEE), unidirectional path tracing can become more adept at handling complex scenes. While this method largely builds on the same principle as the non-\/\+NEE variant, this renderer incorporates additional sampling techniques, as described by Veach \cite{Veach:1995:Optimally}, to improve the rendering of scenes with smaller light sources (as these scenes are often challenging for unidirectional path tracing). In a similar way, create a \textbf{ Path\+Tracing\+Visualizer} with \textbf{ BNEEPT} energy estimator to leverage the benefits of NEE.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_vpm}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Vanilla Photon Mapping}{Vanilla Photon Mapping}}\label{main_feature_overview_vpm}
 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{vpm_perfumes_by_gp3991.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Perfume bottle and its cap rendered with 500M photons (radius\+: 0.1, spp\+: 4). The image has not rendered to convergence to better show the characteristics between different photon mapping techniques.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

It is worth to clarify that the project is named {\itshape Photon} not because the focus is on photon mapping techniques, but because photon is the elementary particle that transmit light, and the primary aim of this project is to solve light transport problems. That said, Photon does offer several photon mapping techniques, with the most fundamental one being vanilla photon mapping as introduced by Jensen \cite{Jensen:1996:Global}. Photon mapping techniques are distinguished by their ability to {\itshape merge} nearby light transport paths, and this form of path reuse allows them to excel on a wider range of lighting phenomena. You can get a vanilla photon mapping renderer by creating a \textbf{ Photon\+Mapping\+Visualizer} and set it to \textbf{ Vanilla} mode.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_ppm}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Progressive Photon Mapping}{Progressive Photon Mapping}}\label{main_feature_overview_ppm}
 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{ppm_perfumes_by_gp3991.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Perfume bottle and its cap rendered with 0.5M photons for 1000 passes (radius\+: 0.1, spp\+: 4). The image has not rendered to convergence to better show the characteristics between different photon mapping techniques.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

This renderer implements the PPM algorithm by Hachisuka et al. \cite{Hachisuka:2008:Progressive} This method improves upon vanilla photon mapping by tracing a fixed set of view vertices as the first pass, then progressively refine the estimation of the incoming energy on those vertices. The rendered result will be closer to ground truth with more view vertices (and the above image is rendered with maximum view path length = 10).

One of the key advantages of progressive photon mapping methods is their ability to utilize an effectively infinite number of photons, which allows it to handle complex lighting scenarios more effectively than vanilla photon mapping. This capability leads to superior rendering results, especially for scenes dominated by specular-\/diffuse-\/specular paths. Create a \textbf{ Photon\+Mapping\+Visualizer} in \textbf{ Progressive} mode to use this renderer.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_sppm}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping}{Stochastic Progressive Photon Mapping}}\label{main_feature_overview_sppm}
 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{sppm_perfumes_by_gp3991.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Perfume bottle and its cap rendered with 0.5M photons for 1000 passes (radius\+: 0.1, spp\+: 4). The image has not rendered to convergence to better show the characteristics between different photon mapping techniques.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

This renderer implements the SPPM algorithm by Hachisuka et al. \cite{Hachisuka:2009:Stochastic}, and is intended to serve as a reference implementation for more sophisticated techniques. The SPPM (and PPM) implementation in Photon tries to avoid tricks and shortcuts where possible, so the evaluated radiance is more likely to remain correct as the project evolves. As a result, this renderer is not optimized for speed and may not be suitable for scenarios where rendering time is a critical factor. Create a \textbf{ Photon\+Mapping\+Visualizer} in \textbf{ Progressive} mode to use this renderer.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_pppm}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Probabilistic Progressive Photon Mapping}{Probabilistic Progressive Photon Mapping}}\label{main_feature_overview_pppm}
 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{pppm_perfumes_by_gp3991.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Perfume bottle and its cap rendered with 0.5M photons for 1000 passes (radius\+: 0.1, spp\+: 4). The image has not rendered to convergence to better show the characteristics between different photon mapping techniques.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

This renderer is based on Knaus and Zwicker\textquotesingle{}s paper \cite{Knaus:2011:Progressive}, which innovatively decouples any intermediate radiance estimate pass from its previous iterations. By isolating each pass\textquotesingle{}s calculations, we can treat any photon mapping technique as a black box and parallelizes the calculation of each pass trivially. However, this approach comes with a trade-\/off\+: increased memory consumption. Because each iteration is treated independently, more memory is required to store the intermediate results. This makes our implementation of PPPM more memory-\/intensive compared to other photon mapping techniques. Create a \textbf{ Photon\+Mapping\+Visualizer} in \textbf{ Progressive} mode to use this renderer.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Scheduler}{Scheduler}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md19}
Some \textbf{ Visualizer}s can make use of a \textbf{ Work\+Scheduler} to distribute rendering work across multiple processor cores. Different types of schedulers dispatch their work in different ways. When rendering an image, a scheduler will typically use the dimensions of the image and number of iterations to define the total volume of work.

\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_observer}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Observer}{Observer}}\label{main_feature_overview_observer}
\textbf{ Observer} plays an important role in capturing and recording a scene\+: it intercepts incoming energy and record it on its sensing device called \textbf{ Film}--so you can observe the virtual world that has been rendered. Observers can generate energy \textbf{ Receiver}s. A common example of an energy receiver is camera, which senses and records lighting as a photograph.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_pinhole}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Pinhole Camera}{Pinhole Camera}}\label{main_feature_overview_pinhole}
 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{pinhole_camera_teaser.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Image rendered by a pinhole camera. Notice the sharpness in foreground and background; there is no difference and it appears to be in focus everywhere.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

Photon currently supports two types of perspective cameras\+: \textbf{ Pinhole\+Camera} and \textbf{ Thin\+Lens\+Camera}. A pinhole camera is simply composed of a small aperture (the "{}pinhole"{}, which serves as its lens system) and a film. Images captured by this camera is similar to how a normal human perceives the world but with several simplifications. Due to its simplicity, it is widely adopted in computer graphics industry. This kind of camera can be generated by creating a \textbf{ Single\+Lens\+Observer} with a zero lens radius.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_thinlens}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Thin Lens Camera}{Thin Lens Camera}}\label{main_feature_overview_thinlens}
 
\begin{DoxyImage}

\doxyfigcaption{Image rendered by a thin-\/lens camera. Notice the depth of field effect.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

For thin lens camera, as its name suggests, the lens system in this camera is assumed to be a single lens with negligible thickness. The biggest advantage of it is that depth of field effects are possible under this model (without introducing too many complexities). In the above render, depth of field is achieved by a 72 mm lens focusing on the first metallic monkey. This camera can be created similarly as \doxysectlink{main_feature_overview_pinhole}{pinhole camera}{2} by using a non-\/zero lens radius.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md20}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Environment Camera}{Environment Camera}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md20}

\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Geometry}{Geometry}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md32}
To represent a ball in the scene, you can use a \textbf{ sphere geometry}; for a piece of paper on a table, a \textbf{ rectangle geometry} can model it pretty well. Geometries are the core components of a scene, providing the structural framework for all other elements like materials, lights and physical motions. In the following sections, we will explore some common types of geometries available in Photon, giving you a rough idea of how these foundational elements are constructed and used in rendering.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md33}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Intersectable and Primitive}{Intersectable and Primitive}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md33}
When a \textbf{ Geometry} is defined in the scene, it will be converted to an \textbf{ Intersectable} before the actual rendering process begins. The renderer further treat some intersectable types as \textbf{ Primitive} from which a richer set of functionalities are expected. In a similar way, some intersectable types are being classified as \textbf{ Intersector} and they typically act as an aggregate of intersectables.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
While these distinctions are not crucial from a user\textquotesingle{}s perspective, they are important for developers or researchers who wish to delve deeper into the source code. Understanding these classifications also makes engine modifications easier.
\end{DoxyNote}
\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md34}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Basic Shapes}{Basic Shapes}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md34}
These are common shapes to have in a renderer and are frequently found in other render engines as well. They are useful not only for modeling objects but also for defining the shape of light sources (or anything that requires a shape). Tessellation is also supported on some types of geometries. We start by introducing the rectangular shape, which can be created by \textbf{ rectangle geometry}.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{rectangle.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Rectangle lies on the XY-\/plane by default. With UV in \mbox{[}0, 1\mbox{]} across the whole surface.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

We also have freestanding triangular shape which can be created by \textbf{ triangle geometry}.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{triangle.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Triangle has customizable UVs and normals.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
It is not recommended to build complex shapes out of multiple freestanding triangle geometries unless you have good reasons to do so. It is highly memory inefficient.
\end{DoxyNote}
There is also spherical shape created by \textbf{ sphere geometry}. The sphere generated is a true sphere by default (not a triangle mesh counterpart).

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{sphere.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{An example sphere shape.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

Using \textbf{ cuboid geometry}, you can build a cube or box shape. Cuboids are axis-\/aligned bounding boxes (AABB) in their local space and allow for variable extents, making them more flexible than standard cubes.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{cuboid.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{A Cuboid (in fact a cube in this image).}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

A bonus to have cuboids is that voxel games like \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft}{\texttt{ Minecraft}} can be rendered easily. Below is a work-\/in-\/progress render of a Minecraft level parser that tries to translate in-\/game data into PSDL\+:

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{textured_mc.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{Test render of a Minecraft level parser.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

Almost all shapes are built from triangle meshes for a typical scene. Games, modeling programs and other applications typically use triangle mesh to represent arbitrary 3-\/D shapes. It is basically a collection of triangles grouped in a way that approximates a target shape. It can be created by \textbf{ triangle mesh geometry} or \textbf{ polygon mesh}. The polygon mesh variant is a more memory efficient representation of a triangle mesh and supports customizable vertex layout and arbitrary index bit precision. Binary storage format is also supported (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLY_(file_format)}{\texttt{ PLY format}}).

\end{DoxyImage}
   \hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md35}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Advanced Shapes}{Advanced Shapes}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md35}
We also support some interesting shapes such as wave and fractals. These special geometries are sometimes useful for modeling a scene. One of them is the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menger_sponge}{\texttt{ Menger sponge}}, a famous fractal shape. It can be created by \textbf{ Menger sponge geometry}.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{menger_sponge.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{A fractal geometry (Menger sponge).}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

The wave shape is basically a cuboid with its top surface tessellated according to a superposition of 2-\/D sine and cosine functions. It can be created by \textbf{ wave geometry}.

 
\begin{DoxyImage}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=\textheight/2,keepaspectratio=true]{045_water_dragon_color_light.jpg}
\doxyfigcaption{A triangle mesh submerged inside a wave geometry.}
\end{DoxyImage}
   

These advanced shapes add versatility to scene modeling in Photon.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md36}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Acceleration Structure}{Acceleration Structure}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md36}
\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md37}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Light}{Light}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md37}
Lighting is a crucial component in rendering a virtual world. Photon provides various types of light sources and emphasizes the use of physically based units for input parameters. This approach is supported by three primary reasons\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Photon is designed as a physically based renderer, using physically based inputs ensures a natural and accurate conveyance of intent.
\item Users can expect consistent renderings between different versions of the software with identical inputs.
\item It is easier to validate the results against real world measurements.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In Photon, lights are represented by a base actor type {\ttfamily \textbf{ ph\+::\+ALight}}. These light actors will be converted to a series of cooked data, including {\ttfamily \textbf{ ph\+::\+Primitive}} (the geometric shape of the light), {\ttfamily \textbf{ ph\+::\+Surface\+Optics}} (the surface material of the light), {\ttfamily \textbf{ ph\+::\+Emitter}} (the energy source of the light), etc. The following sections give a brief overview on the types of light sources implemented in Photon.\hypertarget{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md38}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Emitter}{Emitter}}\label{main_feature_overview_autotoc_md38}
