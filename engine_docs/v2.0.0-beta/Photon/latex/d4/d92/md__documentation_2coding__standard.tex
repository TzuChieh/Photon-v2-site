The development of the core of Photon complies to a collection of rules.\hypertarget{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md13}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Why}{Why}}\label{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md13}
It is benefitial to have a common coding style to follow with, the reasons are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item code is written by one person, but viewed multiple times by others
\item 80\% of the lifetime cost of a piece of software goes to maintenance (from UE4)
\item sometimes higher level concepts can be implied by the layouts
\end{DoxyItemize}

This guideline is for coding in C++ since most of the code for engine is written in it; nonetheless, some concepts can be applied to other parts of Photon (and is encouraged). You do not need to follow all these rules strictly as long as you have a good reason that doing the other way is better for the context.\hypertarget{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md14}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Language and Naming}{Language and Naming}}\label{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md14}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Follow C++20 standard, try to use standard features only.
\item Class names are in capitalized camel case, e.\+g., {\ttfamily Some\+Class\+Name}.
\item Namespaces and function names are in lower case and underscore separated, e,g., {\ttfamily some\+\_\+name}.
\item Member variables should have {\ttfamily m\+\_\+} prefix.
\item Local variables and methods are camel case and uncapitalized, e.\+g., {\ttfamily world\+To\+Local}.
\item Try not to use abbreviations, except for
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily num} for number
\item {\ttfamily pos} for position
\item {\ttfamily dir} for direction
\item common abbreviations in graphics
\item common abbreviations in mathematics
\item formulae in referenced papers
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Classes that defines an interfaces should have an {\ttfamily I} prefix, e.\+g., {\ttfamily IFile\+System}.
\item Name a variable in plural if it is a collection.
\item Boolean variables and methods should ask a question, e.\+g., {\ttfamily m\+\_\+is\+Running}, {\ttfamily has\+Material()}.
\item Use {\ttfamily \#pragma once}. Do {\bfseries{not}} use macro-\/based header guards.
\item Use {\ttfamily PH\+\_\+\+ASSERT} for runtime assertions. See \href{https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2/blob/master/Engine/Source/Common/assertion.h}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Engine/\+Source/\+Common/assertion.\+h}}}.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily .h} for header files
\item {\ttfamily .cpp} for source code
\item {\ttfamily .ipp} for template implementations
\item Include directives should have the following order (with each category separated by a blank line)\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Engine Headers
\item Library Headers
\item Third-\/party Library Headers
\item Standard Headers
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Include engine headers with quotes ({\ttfamily "{}"{}}) and absolute path, relative to {\ttfamily Engine/\+Source/}.
\item Include non-\/engine headers with angle brackets ({\ttfamily \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}).
\item Favor forward declaration over inclusion.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item This can help to reduce compile time over time.
\item Helps to break cyclic dependency.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md16}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Formatting}{Formatting}}\label{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md16}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Curly braces should have their own line.
\item Operators surrounded by spaces.
\item No spaces around brackets and parentheses.
\item Try not to declare multiple variables in single line.
\item Indent with tabs and align with spaces.
\item Do not write comments that state obvious things.
\item Do not indent namespace body.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md17}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{C++ Syntax}{C++ Syntax}}\label{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md17}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Add {\ttfamily const} to anything that is intended to be a constant.
\item Add {\ttfamily const} to methods if it will not alter the state of the object.
\item Add {\ttfamily override} when overriding virtual methods, do not repeat {\ttfamily virtual} in this case.
\item Add a virtual destructor if the object is intended to be used polymorphically.
\item Use {\ttfamily static\+\_\+assert} if you have assumptions that can be verified in compile time.
\item Use {\ttfamily nullptr}, do {\bfseries{not}} use {\ttfamily NULL}.
\item Use {\ttfamily typename} for template type parameters, do {\bfseries{not}} use {\ttfamily class}.
\item Use {\ttfamily constexpr} for constants where you can.
\item {\ttfamily auto} should not be used, except for
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item range based for loops (only when the iterated target is verbose)
\item variable type is obvious, such as constructing smart pointers via {\ttfamily std\+::make\+\_\+shared\texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}T\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>}}
\item TMP where this is necessary, e.\+g., {\ttfamily decltype(auto)}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Perform explicit captures for lambda expressions.
\item Pass by {\ttfamily const} reference if the parameter is not intended to be modified.
\item Pass by non-\/{\ttfamily const} reference and a {\ttfamily out\+\_\+} prefix for partially modified parameters.
\item Pass by non-\/{\ttfamily const} pointer and a {\ttfamily out\+\_\+} prefix for completely modified parameters.
\item Strongly-\/typed enum should always be used, and with a {\ttfamily E} prefix, e.\+g., {\ttfamily enum class EUnit}.
\item Use of anonymous namespaces is encouraged for implementation specific helpers.
\item Do not use {\ttfamily final} everywhere; use it only when the target is {\bfseries{designed not to be}} inherited.
\item Always use a pair of braces for statements ({\ttfamily if}, {\ttfamily for}, {\ttfamily while}, etc.) that contains only a single line.
\item Do not put {\ttfamily using} declarations in global scope.
\item Pointers and references\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Declare like this {\ttfamily ICommand\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*} command}
\item {\bfseries{Not}} like this {\ttfamily ICommand \texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}command}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item If needed, define functions/methods as {\ttfamily inline}, not when declaring them.
\item Do not use {\ttfamily new} and {\ttfamily delete} directly.
\item Make constructor {\ttfamily explicit} if it has single input parameter.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md18}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Primitive Type Aliasing}{Primitive Type Aliasing}}\label{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md18}
Photon uses aliased types most of the time for cross platform compatibilities and ease of tuning. They are declared in \href{https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2/blob/master/Engine/Source/Common/primitive_type.h}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily Engine/\+Source/\+Common/primitive\+\_\+type.\+h}}}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Use {\ttfamily real} for reals, and a {\ttfamily \+\_\+r} suffix for real literals.
\item Use {\ttfamily integer} for integers.
\item If you need specific precision and Photon has it, use it; otherwise use standard types.
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md19}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Others}{Others}}\label{md__documentation_2coding__standard_autotoc_md19}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item All engine code should be under {\ttfamily ph} namespace, preferably with an ending comment\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keyword}{namespace\ }ph}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{}
\DoxyCodeLine{\ \ \textcolor{comment}{//\ some\ code}}
\DoxyCodeLine{\}\textcolor{comment}{//\ end\ namespace\ ph}}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Any function/method with empty body should be formatted like this\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{\textcolor{keywordtype}{void}\ someMeaningfulName()}
\DoxyCodeLine{\{\}}

\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Uninitialized variable/object should have its initializing routine follows immediately, without any blank lines\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{TimeStamp\ someTime;\textcolor{comment}{//\ uninitialized}}
\DoxyCodeLine{m\_timeMachine.getTime(\&someTime);\textcolor{comment}{//\ <someTime>\ initialized}}

\end{DoxyCode}
